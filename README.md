# SVFUnpacker - Windows
It lets you unpack multiple SVFs in one go. Currently, it doesn't have directory recursion. If it's necessary, you can write in the comments.

## Credits
- Me for writing script.

## What does this script do?
This script expands all of your SVF files in one go. I primarily developed this script for unpacking SVF patches for MSDN ISO files. That's why script says SourceISO in itself. But you can use this script in multiple areas.

## What is SVF?
You can think SVF is small patch for a very similar but different file. In example, you may have Vista's RTM 6000 x64 English ISO (3.53GB). But you may want to download Turkish variant of this ISO (3.18GB). You may have slow internet, but if you download patch for that file (164.09MB on https://ow.owowo.workers.dev/dl?id=7vRrvWlkXTC%2Flp06S6hZcp5YHVSm7bHT6Jr8QNzxKJppWBvpc3eB5M2dKcW6yB5lqGVNINZI4ytdZnDu4Yth7Fw%3D&iv=XeMflxaVIZJ%2FSS0r), you can get Turkish variant with that small patch.
