# SVFUnpacker - Windows
It lets you unpack multiple SVFs in one go. Currently, it doesn't have directory recursion.

## Credits
- Me for writing script.
- Gilles Vollant (https://github.com/gvollant) for SmartVersion's smv.exe binary (https://github.com/gvollant/smartversion).

## What does this script do?
This script expands all of your SVF files in one go. I primarily developed this script for unpacking SVF patches for MSDN ISO files. That's why script says SourceISO in itself. But you can use this script in multiple areas.

## Instruction
- Fill required areas.
- See the script does it's magic.

## What is SVF?
You can think SVF is small patch for a get another file that has very similar content compared to source file, but that file has some differences against source file. In example, you may have Vista's RTM 6000 x64 English ISO (3.53GB). But you may want to download Turkish variant of this ISO (3.18GB). You may have slow internet, but if you download patch for that file (164.09MB on https://ow.owowo.workers.dev/dl?id=7vRrvWlkXTC%2Flp06S6hZcp5YHVSm7bHT6Jr8QNzxKJppWBvpc3eB5M2dKcW6yB5lqGVNINZI4ytdZnDu4Yth7Fw%3D&iv=XeMflxaVIZJ%2FSS0r), you can get Turkish variant with that small patch. Just downloading 2 files (3.7GB), you'll get worth of 6.71GB with saving ~%45 bandwith.
